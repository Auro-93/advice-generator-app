## Overview

### The challenge

This is a simple React application that allows the user to generate random alerts by clicking on a dedicated button that fetches the data from the Advice Slip JSON API.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
